# The Pensieve Index - Development Roadmap

**Spec-Kit Driven Development Phases**

This document outlines the complete development roadmap for The Pensieve Index using GitHub's Spec-Kit methodology.

## 📋 Overview

The Pensieve Index follows a **library-first approach** to fanfiction discovery, prioritizing existing story search over prompt generation. The development is structured in phases that build incrementally on each other, ensuring a working system at each stage.

## 🗺️ Development Phases

### **Phase 1: Core Admin System (Spec 004 - ✅ COMPLETE)**

**Status**: ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED & OPERATIONAL**

```powershell
# Specification (Already completed)
/specify "Build a hierarchical admin system with Project Admins who can create fandoms and assign Fandom Admins, plus Fandom Admins who manage their specific fandom content. Project Admins have global permissions to create/edit fandoms, assign admin roles, and access all validation rules. Fandom Admins can only manage tags, plot blocks, validation rules, and story submissions for their assigned fandoms. Include role-based access control, admin invitation system, and audit logging for all admin actions. Focus on single-fandom management first."

# Implementation Plan (Completed)
/plan "Next.js 13+ with TypeScript 5.x and Drizzle ORM using better-sqlite3. Implement two-tier admin hierarchy with Clerk authentication. Create AdminRoleService and AdminPermissionService with RBAC validation. Build InvitationService with email workflows. Add AuditLogService for comprehensive action tracking. Create admin dashboard components with mobile-responsive Tailwind CSS. Implement permission validators with sync/async support. Add user management interfaces with role assignment. Include comprehensive testing with Vitest."
```

**Delivered Features:**
- ✅ Two-tier admin roles (ProjectAdmin/FandomAdmin)
- ✅ Role-based access control (RBAC) with comprehensive permission validation
- ✅ Admin invitation system with email-based workflow
- ✅ Comprehensive audit logging for all admin actions
- ✅ Mobile-responsive admin dashboards
- ✅ User & fandom management interfaces
- ✅ 43/43 core admin tests passing (100% success rate)
