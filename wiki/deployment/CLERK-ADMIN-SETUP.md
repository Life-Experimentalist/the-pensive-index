### ‚ùå Still Getting "Access Denied"?

   {
     "role": "ProjectAdmin"
   }
   ```
3. **Refresh the Page**: Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5)

### ‚ùå Can't Find Your User?

1. **Make sure you signed in**: Complete the sign-in process at least once

3. **Wait a moment**: Sometimes it takes a few seconds for new users to appear

### ‚ùå Unauthorized After Setting Role?

1. **Hard refresh**: Press Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
2. **Check role spelling**: Must be exactly `ProjectAdmin` or `FandomAdmin`

## Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your `.env.local`:
```bash
# Clerk Authentication (replace with your real keys)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_key_here
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_here

# Clerk routing
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/admin
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/admin
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_USER_PROFILE_URL=/user-profile
```

## Important Notes

- ‚úÖ User roles are checked on every admin page access
- ‚úÖ Roles must be set in Clerk's **public metadata** (not private metadata)
- ‚úÖ Changes to roles take effect immediately after saving in Clerk dashboard
- ‚úÖ Users without admin roles will be redirected to unauthorized page
- ‚úÖ The hydration warning in console is normal (browser extensions cause it)

## Need More Help?

If you're still having issues:

1. **Check the browser console**: Look for any error messages
2. **Verify environment variables**: Make sure your Clerk keys are correct
3. **Test with incognito mode**: Rules out browser extension issues
4. **Check Clerk dashboard logs**: Look for authentication events

The setup should work immediately after adding the role to public metadata! üéâ
